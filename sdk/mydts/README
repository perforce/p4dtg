GENERIC DEFECT TRACKING SYSTEM INTEGRATION BASED ON C++
=======================================================
This is the source for a plugin which provides the required functional
interfaces for a generic defect tracking system required by the
Perforce Defect Tracking Gateway.

DTG-mod-cpp.cc		C++ implementation of the required interface
			This file should pretty much be used as is
CMakeLists.txt		Cmake build definition file
MyDTG.cc		C++ implementation of the class encapsulating 
			the base Defect Tracking System
MyDTGDefect.cc		C++ implementation of the class encapsulating
			specific 'Defects'
MyDTG.h			C++ Class definition file for the MyDTG, MyDTGProj, 
			MyDTGDefect classes. Add additional attributes and
			methods as needed by the plugin have been added
MyDTGProj.cc		C++ Class definition file for the MyDTGProj class
			encapsulating specific 'Projects' within a defect
			tracking system installation.
MyDTS.cc		C++ implementation of the MyDTS class
MyDTS.h			C++ class encapsulating the defect tracking system's
			api to provide the information necessary for the
			plugin.
