P4 JOBS INTEGRATION BASED ON C++
=================================
This is the source for a plugin which provides the required functional
interfaces to the Perforce Jobs System. This plugin is provide as
part of the P4DTG SDK as a complete example and should not be built
or distributed.

NOTE: It is not expected that your environment will support building
      of this plugin as it has requirements specific to the Perforce
      build and release environment.

DTG-mod-cpp.cc		C++ implementation of the required interface
			This file should pretty much be used as is
CMakeLists.txt		Cmake build definition file
MyDTG.cc		C++ implementation of the class encapsulating 
			the base P4 Jobs Defect Tracking System
MyDTGDefect.cc		C++ implementation of the class encapsulating
			specific 'Defects' aka Jobs
MyDTG.h			C++ Class definition file for the MyDTG, MyDTGProj, 
			MyDTGDefect classes. Add additional attributes and
			methods as needed by the plugin have been added

			encapsulating specific 'Projects' within a p4d
			installationa and it is called 'Jobs'.
